      <h3>Who am I</h3>
      <p>
        Hi, my name is Jet and I am a software engineer based in Eindhoven,
        the Netherlands.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite the fact that I choose to dedicate my career to software
        engineering, I’ve always been dreaming about becoming a teacher ever
        since I was a kid. Teaching others gives me a sense of accomplishment
        that always fascinate me.
      </p>
      <p>So, here I am ;)</p>
      <p>
        I am not a smart guy, I always had to spend twice as much time as
        others did to reach the same level. I know how terrible it feels when
        not being able to understand a shit after reading several posts on
        Stack Overflow. So, at this website, I try to explain things in a way
        that everyone can easily understand, including any dumbass like me.
      </p>
      <p>
        The content at this website will revolve around programming basics and
        tricks I’ve learned in my career. I hope what I write can provide some
        help to you, cheers.
      </p>
